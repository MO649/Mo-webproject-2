    <h2>4. What communities are involved and what is their ethnic affiliation is or what Nation they are from?</h2>
    <h4>Treaty 1 signed in 1871 involved Indigenous Nations such as the Ojibwe, Anishinaabe, Cree, and Saulteaux, mostly from southern Manitoba, who were represented by bands like the Peguis, Norway House Cree, and Sioux Valley Dakota, and others. </h4>
    <h2>5. What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was included in the Treaty (ex. the outside promises, how much land each family of five were to receive, etc.). </h2>
    <h4> The historic terms of treaties usually included giving up land, receiving yearly payments or goods, land for families to live on, promises of peace and protection, rights to hunt and fish, and help with education and healthcare, Evan though they never actually did what the promised. </h4>
    <h2>6. What makes this Treaty different from other Treaties in Canada? </h2>
    <h4>Treaty 1 is unique because it was the first of the numbered treaties, signed on August 3, 1871, between the Crown and the Saulteaux and Cree peoples in Southern Manitoba specifically near Fort Garry (modern-day Winnipeg), distinguishing it by its date, people who signed it, and location. </h4>
    <h2>7. How is the Treaty being implemented today. For example, information about urban reserves (ex. Kapyong Urban Reserve, Long Plain First Nations Gas Station, etc.) or economic development in Treaty communities?  </h2>
    <h4>Today, Treaty 1 is being put into action through projects like e.g., Kapyong Urban reserves and businesses like gas stations helping First Nations communities create jobs, manage resources, and make their own decisions also the. </h4>
