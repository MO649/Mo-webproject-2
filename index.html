        </h2>
        <h4 class="par">
          Treaty 1 signed in 1871 involved Indigenous Nations such as the
          Ojibwe, Anishinaabe, Cree, and Saulteaux, mostly from southern
          Manitoba, who were represented by bands like the Peguis, Norway House
          Cree, and Sioux Valley Dakota, and others.

        <h2>
          5. What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was
          included in the Treaty (ex. the outside promises, how much land each
          family of five were to receive, etc.).
        </h2>
        <h4 class="par">
          The historic terms of treaties usually included giving up land,
          receiving yearly payments or goods, land for families to live on,
          promises of peace and protection, rights to hunt and fish, and help
          with education and healthcare, Evan though they never actually did
          what the promised.

        <h2>
          6. What makes this Treaty different from other Treaties in Canada?
        </h2>
        <h4 class="par">
          Treaty 1 is unique because it was the first of the numbered treaties,
          signed on August 3, 1871, between the Crown and the Saulteaux and Cree
          peoples in Southern Manitoba specifically near Fort Garry (modern-day
          Winnipeg), distinguishing it by its date, people who signed it, and
          location.

        <h2>
          7. How is the Treaty being implemented today. For example, information
          about urban reserves (ex. Kapyong Urban Reserve, Long Plain First
          Nations Gas Station, etc.) or economic development in Treaty
          communities?
        </h2>
        <h4 class="par">
          Today, Treaty 1 is being put into action through projects like e.g.,
          Kapyong Urban reserves and businesses like gas stations helping First
          Nations communities create jobs, manage resources, and make their own
          decisions also the.
