          Treaty 1 signed in 1871 involved Indigenous Nations such as the
          Ojibwe, Anishinaabe, Cree, and Saulteaux, mostly from southern
          Manitoba, who were represented by bands like the Peguis, Norway House
          Cree, and Sioux Valley Dakota, and others.

          5. What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was

        </h2>
        <h4 class="par" tabindex="0">
          The historic terms of treaties usually included giving up land,
          receiving yearly payments or goods, land for families to live on,
          promises of peace and protection, rights to hunt and fish, and help
          with education and healthcare, Evan though they never actually did
          what the promised.

        <h4 class="par" tabindex="0">
          Treaty 1 is unique because it was the first of the numbered treaties,
          signed on August 3, 1871, between the Crown and the Saulteaux and Cree
          peoples in Southern Manitoba specifically near Fort Garry (modern-day
          Winnipeg), distinguishing it by its date, people who signed it, and
          location.
