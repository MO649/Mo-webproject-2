                Treaty 1 signed in 1871 involved Indigenous Nations such as the Ojibwe,
                Anishinaabe, Cree, and Saulteaux, mostly from southern Manitoba, who
                were represented by bands like the Peguis, Norway House Cree, and Sioux

                5. What are the historic terms of the Treaty, meaning what was included
                in the Treaty (ex. the outside promises, how much land each family of
                five were to receive, etc.).

            <h4 class="par">
                The historic terms of treaties usually included giving up land,
                receiving yearly payments or goods, land for families to live on,
                promises of peace and protection, rights to hunt and fish, and help with
                education and healthcare, Evan though they never actually did what the

            </h2>
            <h4 class="par">
                Treaty 1 is unique because it was the first of the numbered treaties,
                signed on August 3, 1871, between the Crown and the Saulteaux and Cree
                peoples in Southern Manitoba specifically near Fort Garry (modern-day
                Winnipeg), distinguishing it by its date, people who signed it, and
                location.

                7. How is the Treaty being implemented today. For example, information

            </h2>
            <h4 class="par">
                Today, Treaty 1 is being put into action through projects like e.g.,
                Kapyong Urban reserves and businesses like gas stations helping First
                Nations communities create jobs, manage resources, and make their own
                decisions also the.
